# Using Classes in Java

In **IntelliJ IDEA**, create a **New Project** called MyMath.

In the **src** folder create a **Java class** file called *MyMath.java* with the following source code.

## Exercises

Complete the following exercises by creating methods in a **Point** class.

## 06-0:  Distance

Complete the following function, that returns the **distance between two points**.

```java
public double distance(Point p1, Point p2) {
	0.0
}
```

## 06-1:  Slope

	Fraction(1,1)
}
```

## 06-3:  Add

Complete the following method, that returns the **sum** of an **instance** of **Fraction** and another **Fraction** f.
