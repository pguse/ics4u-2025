# Using Classes in Rust

In **IntelliJ IDEA**, create a **New Project** called **Point**.

In the **src** folder create a **Java class** file called *Point.java* with the following source code.

## Exercises

Complete the following exercises by creating methods in the Point class.

## 06-0:  Distance

Complete the following function, that returns the **distance between two points**.

```java
public double distance(Point p1, Point p2) {
	0.0
}
```

## 06-1:  Slope

Complete the following function, that returns the **slope of a line passing through two points**.

```java
public double slope(Point p1, Point p2) {
	0.0
}
```

In **IntelliJ IDEA**, create a **New Project** called **Fraction**.

In the **src** folder create a **Java class** file called *Fraction.java* with the following source code.

## 06-2:  Divide

Complete the following method, that returns the **quotient** of an **instance** of **Fraction** and another **Fraction** f.

```java
public Fraction div(self, Fraction f) {
	Fraction(1,1)
}
```

# 06-3:  Add

Complete the following method, that returns the **sum** of an **instance** of **Fraction** and another **Fraction** f.

```java
public Fraction add(self, Fraction f) -> Fraction {
	Fraction(1,1)
}
```

## 09-4:  Subtract

Complete the following method, that returns the **difference** of an **instance** of **Fraction** and another **Fraction** f.

```java
public Fraction subt(self, Fraction f) {
	Fraction(1,1)
}
```
